    <p>To-do lists don't need to be complicatedâ€”plenty of people use 
      a pen and paper for the job without any problem. 
      And yet a new to-do list app seems to come out every day.
       Why? Because keeping track of your tasks is an intensely personal thing, 
       and people will reject anything that doesn't feel right pretty much instantly.
        That makes it hard to find the right app.</p>
 <p>To that end, we've been hard at work researching the best to-do apps, 
     trying to find the right ones for various use cases.
    Research for these pieces was exhaustive.
    We started by finding the best apps for every platform: Android, Windows,
      macOS, and iPhone/iPad. We then tried the top-rated apps in every respective 
     app store, and spent way too much time migrating our personal
   to-do lists from one app to another.</p>
        <p>And now we're offering you what we feel is the cream of the crop.
           Whatever you're looking for, one of these apps is going to be right for you. 
           Click on any app to learn more about why we chose it, 
           or keep reading for more context on to-do list apps.</p>
